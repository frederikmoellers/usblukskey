Q: Why do You use system() to load the module and not some native C interfaces?

A: There's a (small) discussion about this here:
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5947286/how-can-linux-kernel-modules-be-loaded-from-c-code
   While I do believe that one shouldn't use system() where it can be avoided,
   I don't think there's a better way of loading a module. init_module() can be
   used to load a module, but for this we need the module data or at least the
   module file. In order to find that, we'd have to search the modules of the
   current kernel etc. As You can see, it would get way more complicated and
   modprobe takes all this work from us. So in this case, system() is actually
   the cleanest way to load a module.


Q: Why do You use semaphores instead of mutexes?

A: Mutexes have to be locked and unlocked within the same thread. Also, mutexes
   have to be destroyed before being deleted. Both these constraints are
   problematic in this program and semaphores are a possible and easy solution.


Q: Why do You use CMake for such a small application?

A: I wanted to try it and this seemed like a good place to start. Also, it
   reduces the installation effort for users to 1 command: make install.
